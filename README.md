# New Framework Being Build
I am currently developing a new framework for RedM. <br>
Below you will find some info on DokusCore, once we <br>
are further in development, we will post more information

---
# Requirements
[DokusCore Setting Menu](https://github.com/DokusCore/DokusCore--SettingsMenu)
[DokusCore Multi Characters](https://github.com/DokusCore/DokusCore--MultiCharacters)

# Feature Teasers:
- **Multi Language Support**
  - English
  - Dutch
  - Bulgarian
  - German
  - Danish
  - Spanish
  - French
  - Greek
  - Italian
  - Polish
  - Portuguese
  - Russian
  -
- **Make your server international!** <br>
You can choose to force a server language for everyone, or you<br>
can turn multi language support on, and let your players decide <br>
their own client language. This mean that every player on your <br>
server can have his/her own language set. Very usefull for servers<br>
that have players from all over the world.<br><br>
- **Build in Blacklist/Banlist** <br>
With this build in blacklist you can be assured user can't come back<br>
by simply changing there IP or Steam address. Our blacklist will also <br>
ban them by the RedM license, XBox license and the Live license. If <br>
any of these values are in the database, the user will be blocked<br>
from joining your server.<br><br>
- **Toggle all commands to your wish** <br>
Every had that problem where you have admins, but you do not want<br>
them to use every admin | chat command ? We got you covered. With <br>
DokusCore, each chat commando can be toggled for Superadmins, Admins<br>
and users. So you are now 100% in control! No more admin abuse!<br>

- **Build In Anti AFK System** <br>
The Anti AFK System will automatically kick players from your <br>
server is they have been standing still for a x amount of minutes.<br>
Players will recieve a warning before this happens.<br>
You can easly toggle this on or off, and set the time in the config.<br>

---
# Teaser for Developers <br>
* DokusCore will have a build in callback system. With these<br>
  callbacks you can request data from client|server|client or <br>
  server|client|server without the need to stop and creating<br>
  a new event trigger. The event will simply wait for the <br>
  callback to return it's data before it continues with<br>
  the rest.
* Many things like editing|inserting|deleting the database<br>
  are done internally by the Core. You only have to use one <br>
  of the callback triggers and pass on the right arguments.<br>
  No need to type out all that sql stuff!

# Quality over Quantity <br>
Quality will always be the number 1 priority.
