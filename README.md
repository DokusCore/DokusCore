# Introduction
DokusCore is a ( Red Dead Redepmtion 2 ) RedM roleplay framework that is <br>
designed to bring your roleplay to a new level. DokusCore is easy installed <br>
and is maintained on a regular basis by its developers. DokusCore makes it <br>
easy for developers as the core itself will do most of the coding calculation, <br>
so that developers can build their plugins with the least amount of code. <br>
DokusCore is optimized for better server performance, with most of all plugins <br>
running 0.00ms server side and 0.00/0.01ms client side on idle. There are many <br>
more things that we will show you below.

# Server Prebuild:
If you do not want to build your own server you don't have to, we already did all   <br>
the work for you! Download our [Prebuild](https://github.com/DokusCore/Server-Prebuild) server package and you will be setup  <br>
within minutes. You also do not have to worry about dependencies or if the plugins <br>
are started in the right order. Just insert your server artifacts, change the .cfg <br>
and config files to your liking and off you go! For more information on how to <br>
set up a DokusCore server, see the following video: [Installation video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlJFFRzWvDE) <br>

# Intergraded Callback System
Developing on DokusCore is made easy with the callback system. You're able to <br>
pull data from a client file into a server file and vice versa without stopping <br>
your current event. Normally you if you want to pull server info you had to stop <br>
your client event, go to a server event to push data back to a new client event. <br>
This would bloat your code and make coding and your plugin complicated. The <br>
callbacks are placed inside a variable, and it will simply wait for it to return <br>
with data before it continues the rest of the code. This way, you are able to <br>
write your plugin completely client sided, without even making a dedicated server <br>
file!

# Edits? No need to restart ( DataSync )
DokusCore comes with a plugin called DataSync. This plugin is solely dedicated <br>
to store user and server data, this so that ( almost ) all plugins incl the <br>
core framework itself can be restarted on a running server. Once a plugin <br>
(re)starts, it will simply ask DataSync for the stored data and sets itself up <br>
properly for use. This way no data has to be stored in the plugins themselves, <br>
and prevents users from the need to relog on your server.  As said almost all <br>
plugins can be restarted but of course not DataSync! If you restart DataSync on <br>
a running server, it will lose all user data and all plugins will be unable to <br>
continue running. A full restart need to be done, though this also can be done <br>
on a running server. In case you accidentally restart DataSync, first restart <br>
DokusCore then restart all other plugins. The framework will then be up-to-date <br>
again.

# Realism Makes Roleplay! ( In Progress )
You can have a full server with many plugins, but if the way it is intended to <br>
be used is not realistic, your roleplay experience will be impaired also. <br>
DokusCore will focus more on realism to boost your roleplay experience. Though <br>
server owners can assign you a job, jobs will become skill and experience based <br>
the more you do it, the better you become at it. All jobs, stores and companies <br>
have stocks, if the stock runs empty they will not be able to operate. This <br>
gives players a reason to continue to work jobs as this directly impacts the <br>
economy, this also fluctuates the taxation on states and therefore the prices <br>
of goods and services. Players will, for example, later be able to buy in at <br>
one store cheap, and sell it to other places on the map at higher prices. When <br>
a store is empty it will be unable to sell, when the stable is empty you will <br>
need hunters to get some new horses. For a low populated server, we will build <br>
in a system where NPCs will start to do the critical jobs to keep the economy <br>
stable. The ideas listed above in this realism section are work in process and <br>
at current time not yet build into the core, but it gives you an overview on how <br>
we want to use the economy and environment to boost you and your players roleplay <br>
experience

# Multi Languages
With DokusCore you are not bound to 1 specific language! Ever had the idea to  <br>
set up an international server that hosts people with multiple languages? Where  <br>
you are not able to due to the fact not everyone was able to read the same  <br>
language? With DokusCore you do not only have the possibility to switch your  <br>
entire server to a different language via 1 config edit, all your users  <br>
( if you allow ) are able to set their own client language in the user settings  <br>
menu. If a user desires a different language it can be switched in game without <br>
restart or relog needed, instantly all text in game for this specific user will  <br>
be switched to his/her desired language. This way you can host an international  <br>
server and have all users read the notifications in their own languages.

# Update notifications
When DokusCore or one of its plugins had an update, you will see this as a <br>
notification in your server console on server startup. DokusCore hosts a unique <br>
way for you to track the up-to-date status of your server and all its plugins. <br>
Currently, it will only check the version of all DokusCore plugins, but at a <br>
later stage you will also be able to add in your own plugins to the list to keep <br>
track off. If developers made a plugin for DokusCore and submit it to us, we <br>
will add this plugin on the update check list if the developer is maintaining <br>
the version numbers correctly. Below, a picture on how the notification looks.
