-- NOTE: [1] The DBSET Banking has been changed. All internal commands that use
-- to add money to users accounts need to be edited to make them work again.
-- Specially addmoney and addgold command. These are now not working.

-- NOTE: [2] The deprecation warnings are coming from mysql-async
-- the author does not seem to fix this, so lets do it our selfs and
-- prepack mysql-async as own version to DokusCore dependencies

-- NOTE: [3] Commands like add money / gold and Discord seem to have stopped
-- working. Check what went wrong and corrent this issue.
